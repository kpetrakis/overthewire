Run: mkdir /tmp/bandit31git && cd /tmp/bandit31git to create a directory to download the git repo.

I run git clone ssh://bandit31-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit31-git/repo to get the repo.

I run cat README.md and I see : 

This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master

So I create a key.txt with the required contents, but when I run 'git status' I see that there is no modified file.

So I check .gitignore, I see that all *.txt files are ignored...

I run git add -f key.txt, to stage the file

I run git commit -m "key.txt" to commit the file

I run git push --set-upstream origin master to push the file in the remote repo.
