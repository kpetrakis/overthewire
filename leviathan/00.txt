I don't see any relevan file in the home directory. I check the contents of .backup dir and it contains a bookmarks.html file. 

I guessed the password will be in here. I run : cat .backup/bookmarks.html  | grep password and I got :

<DT><A HREF="http://leviathan.labs.overthewire.org/passwordus.html | This will be fixed later, the password for leviathan1 is 3QJ3TgzHDq" ADD_DATE="1155384634" LAST_CHARSET="ISO-8859-1" ID="rdf:#$2wIU71">password to leviathan1</A>

So I see that the password for the next level is: 3QJ3TgzHDq

passwd for level 1: 3QJ3TgzHDq
