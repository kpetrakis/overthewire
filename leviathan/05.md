# Leviathan level 5

I see a set-uid executable in home directory. Running I get `Cannot find /tmp/file.log` . So I create a dummy file in /tmp/log with `echo dummy > /tmp/file.log`

Now Running `ltrace ./leviathan5`  I get:

```

I see that the programm just gives me the contents of the file and then deletes it. But it reads the contents before changing privileges. So I guess I just have to make a symbolic link to the password file to get the contents of it.

I created `/tmp/file.log` again with the command: `ln -sf /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6 /tmp/file.log`

Running `./leviathan5` I get the contents of `/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6`
